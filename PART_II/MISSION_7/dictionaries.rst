Dictionaries
============

All of the compound data types we have studied in detail so far --- strings,
lists, and tuples --- are sequence types, which use integers as indices to access
the values they contain within them.

**Dictionaries** are yet another kind of compound type. They are Python's
built-in **mapping type**. They map **keys**, which can be any immutable type,
to values, which can be any type (heterogeneous), just like the elements
of a list or tuple. In other languages, they are called associative
arrays since they associate a key with a value.

As an example, we will create a dictionary to translate English words into
Spanish. For this dictionary, the keys are strings.

One way to create a dictionary is to start with the empty dictionary and add
**key:value pairs**. The empty dictionary is denoted ``{}``:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> eng2sp = {}
        >>> eng2sp["one"] = "uno"
        >>> eng2sp["two"] = "dos"

The first assignment creates a dictionary named ``eng2sp``; the other
assignments add new key:value pairs to the dictionary. We can print the current
value of the dictionary in the usual way:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> print(eng2sp)
        {"two": "dos", "one": "uno"}

The key:value pairs of the dictionary are separated by commas. Each pair
contains a key and a value separated by a colon.

.. admonition:: Hashing

    The order of the pairs may not be what was expected. Python uses
    complex algorithms, designed for very fast access, to determine
    where the key:value pairs are stored in a dictionary. For our
    purposes we can think of this ordering as unpredictable.

    You also might wonder why we use dictionaries at all when the same
    concept of mapping a key to a value could be implemented using a
    list of tuples:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> {"apples": 430, "bananas": 312, "oranges": 525, "pears": 217}
        {'pears': 217, 'apples': 430, 'oranges': 525, 'bananas': 312}
        >>> [('apples', 430), ('bananas', 312), ('oranges', 525), ('pears', 217)]
        [('apples', 430), ('bananas', 312), ('oranges', 525), ('pears', 217)]

    The reason is dictionaries are very fast, implemented using a
    technique called hashing, which allows us to access a value very
    quickly. By contrast, the list of tuples implementation is slow. If
    we wanted to find a value associated with a key, we would have to
    iterate over every tuple, checking the 0th element. What if the key
    wasn't even in the list? We would have to get to the end of it to
    find out.

Another way to create a dictionary is to provide a list of key:value pairs
using the same syntax as the previous output:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> eng2sp = {"one": "uno", "two": "dos", "three": "tres"}

It doesn't matter what order we write the pairs. The values in a dictionary are
accessed with keys, not with indices, so there is no need to care about
ordering.

Here is how we use a key to look up the corresponding value:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> print(eng2sp["two"])
        'dos'

The key ``"two"`` yields the value ``"dos"``.

Lists, tuples, and strings have been called *sequences*, because their items
occur in order.  The dictionary is the first compound type that we've
seen that is not a sequence, so we can't index or slice a dictionary. 

Dictionary operations
---------------------

The ``del`` statement removes a key:value pair from a dictionary. For example,
the following dictionary contains the names of various fruits and the number of
each fruit in stock:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> inventory = {"apples": 430, "bananas": 312, "oranges": 525, "pears": 217}
        >>> print(inventory)
        {'pears': 217, 'apples': 430, 'oranges': 525, 'bananas': 312}

If someone buys all of the pears, we can remove the entry from the dictionary:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> del inventory["pears"]
        >>> print(inventory)
        {'apples': 430, 'oranges': 525, 'bananas': 312}

Or if we're expecting more pears soon, we might just change the value
associated with pears:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> inventory["pears"] = 0
        >>> print(inventory)
        {'pears': 0, 'apples': 430, 'oranges': 525, 'bananas': 312}
    
A new shipment of bananas arriving could be handled like this:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> inventory["bananas"] += 200
        >>> print(inventory)
        {'pears': 0, 'apples': 430, 'oranges': 525, 'bananas': 512}

The ``len`` function also works on dictionaries; it returns the number
of key:value pairs:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> len(inventory)
        4


Dictionary methods
------------------

Dictionaries have a number of useful built-in methods.

The ``keys`` method returns what Python 3 calls a **view** of its underlying keys.  
A view object has some similarities to the ``range`` object we saw earlier ---
it is a lazy promise, to deliver its elements when they're needed by the 
rest of the program.  We can iterate over the view, or turn the view into a 
list like this:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        for k in eng2sp.keys():   # The order of the k's is not defined
           print("Got key", k, "which maps to value", eng2sp[k])     
           
        ks = list(eng2sp.keys())
        print(ks)
    
This produces this output:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        Got key three which maps to value tres
        Got key two which maps to value dos
        Got key one which maps to value uno
        ['three', 'two', 'one']
    
It is so common to iterate over the keys in a dictionary that we can
omit the ``keys`` method call in the ``for`` loop --- iterating over
a dictionary implicitly iterates over its keys:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        for k in eng2sp:     
           print("Got key", k)     
       

The ``values`` method is similar; it returns a view object which can be turned
into a list:  

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> list(eng2sp.values())
        ['tres', 'dos', 'uno']

The ``items`` method also returns a view, which promises a list of tuples --- one 
tuple for each key:value pair:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> list(eng2sp.items())
        [('three', 'tres'), ('two', 'dos'), ('one', 'uno')]
    
Tuples are often useful for getting both the key and the value at the same
time while we are looping:

    .. code-block:: python
    
       for (k,v) in eng2sp.items():
           print("Got",k,"that maps to",v)
           
This produces:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        Got three that maps to tres
        Got two that maps to dos
        Got one that maps to uno

    
The ``in`` and ``not in`` operators can test if a key is in the dictionary:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> "one" in eng2sp
        True
        >>> "six" in eng2sp
        False
        >>> "tres" in eng2sp    # Note that 'in' tests keys, not values.
        False
     

This method can be very useful, since looking up a non-existent key in a
dictionary causes a runtime error:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> eng2esp["dog"]
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          ...
        KeyError: 'dog'

Aliasing and copying
--------------------

As in the case of lists, because dictionaries are mutable, we need to be 
aware of aliasing.  Whenever
two variables refer to the same object, changes to one affect the other.

If we want to modify a dictionary and keep a copy of the original, use the
``copy`` method. For example, ``opposites`` is a dictionary that contains pairs
of opposites:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> opposites = {"up": "down", "right": "wrong", "yes": "no"}
        >>> alias = opposites
        >>> copy = opposites.copy()  # Shallow copy

``alias`` and ``opposites`` refer to the same object; ``copy`` refers to a
fresh copy of the same dictionary. If we modify ``alias``, ``opposites`` is
also changed:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> alias["right"] = "left"
        >>> opposites["right"]
        'left'

If we modify ``copy``, ``opposites`` is unchanged:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> copy["right"] = "privilege"
        >>> opposites["right"]
        'left'

Sparse matrices
---------------

We previously used a list of lists to represent a matrix. That is a good choice
for a matrix with mostly nonzero values, but consider a `sparse matrix
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix>`__. The list representation contains a lot of zeroes:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        matrix = [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 3, 0]]

An alternative is to use a dictionary. For the keys, we can use tuples that
contain the row and column numbers. Here is the dictionary representation of
the same matrix:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> matrix = {(0, 3): 1, (2, 1): 2, (4, 3): 3}

We only need three key:value pairs, one for each nonzero element of the matrix.
Each key is a tuple, and each value is an integer.

To access an element of the matrix, we could use the ``[]`` operator:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> matrix[(0, 3)]
        1

Notice that the syntax for the dictionary representation is not the same as the
syntax for the nested list representation. Instead of two integer indices, we
use one index, which is a tuple of integers.

There is one problem. If we specify an element that is zero, we get an error,
because there is no entry in the dictionary with that key:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> matrix[(1, 3)]
        KeyError: (1, 3)

The ``get`` method solves this problem:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> matrix.get((0, 3), 0)
        1

The first argument is the key; the second argument is the value ``get`` should
return if the key is not in the dictionary:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> matrix.get((1, 3), 0)
        0

``get`` definitely improves the semantics of accessing a sparse matrix.  Shame
about the syntax.

Memoization
-----------

If you played around with the ``fibo`` function from the chapter on recursion, you
might have noticed that the bigger the argument you provide, the longer the
function takes to run. Furthermore, the run time increases very quickly. On one
of our machines, ``fib(20)`` finishes instantly, ``fib(30)`` takes
about a second, and ``fib(40)`` takes roughly forever.

To understand why, consider doing a **call graph**, a call graph shows some function frames (instances when the function has been invoked), with lines connecting each frame to
the frames of the functions it calls. At the top of the graph, ``fib``
with ``n = 4`` calls ``fib`` with ``n = 3`` and ``n = 2``. In turn,
``fib`` with ``n = 3`` calls ``fib`` with ``n = 2`` and ``n = 1``.
And so on.

Count how many times ``fib(0)`` and ``fib(1)`` are called.  This is
an inefficient solution to the problem, and it gets far worse as the argument
gets bigger.

A good solution is to keep track of values that have already been computed by
storing them in a dictionary. A previously computed value that is stored for
later use is called a **memo**. Here is an implementation of ``fib``
using memos:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        alreadyknown = {0: 0, 1: 1}
           
        def fib(n):
            if n not in alreadyknown:
                new_value = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
                alreadyknown[n] = new_value
            return alreadyknown[n]

The dictionary named ``alreadyknown`` keeps track of the Fibonacci numbers we
already know. We start with only two pairs: 0 maps to 1; and 1 maps to 1.

Whenever ``fib`` is called, it checks the dictionary to determine if it
contains the result. If it's there, the function can return immediately without
making any more recursive calls. If not, it has to compute the new value. The
new value is added to the dictionary before the function returns.

Using this version of ``fib``, our machines can compute
``fib(100)`` in an eyeblink.

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> fib(100)
        354224848179261915075

Counting letters
----------------

In the exercises in Chapter 8 (Strings) we wrote a function that counted the number of occurrences of a
letter in a string. A more general version of this problem is to form a
frequency table of the letters in the string, that is, how many times each letter
appears.

Such a frequency table might be useful for compressing a text file. Because different
letters appear with different frequencies, we can compress a file by using
shorter codes for common letters and longer codes for letters that appear less
frequently.

Dictionaries provide an elegant way to generate a frequency table:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> letter_counts = {}
        >>> for letter in "Mississippi":
        ...     letter_counts[letter] = letter_counts.get(letter, 0) + 1
        ...
        >>> letter_counts
        {'M': 1, 's': 4, 'p': 2, 'i': 4}

We start with an empty dictionary. For each letter in the string, we find the
current count (possibly zero) and increment it. At the end, the dictionary
contains pairs of letters and their frequencies.

It might be more appealing to display the frequency table in alphabetical order. We
can do that with the ``items`` and ``sort`` methods:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        >>> letter_items = list(letter_counts.items())
        >>> letter_items.sort()
        >>> print(letter_items)
        [('M', 1), ('i', 4), ('p', 2), ('s', 4)]

Notice in the first line we had to call the type conversion function ``list``.
That turns the promise we get from ``items`` into a list, a step that is 
needed before we can use the list's ``sort`` method. 

Glossary
--------
       
    call graph 
        A graph consisting of nodes which represent function frames (or invocations), 
        and directed edges (lines with arrows) showing which frames gave
        rise to other frames.       
        
    dictionary
        A collection of key:value pairs that maps from keys to values. The keys
        can be any immutable value, and the associated value can be of any type.

    immutable data value
        A data value which cannot be modified.  Assignments to elements or
        slices (sub-parts) of immutable values cause a runtime error.

    key
        A data item that is *mapped to* a value in a dictionary. Keys are used
        to look up values in a dictionary. Each key must be unique
        across the dictionary.

    key:value pair
        One of the pairs of items in a dictionary. Values are looked up in a
        dictionary by key.
        
    mapping type
        A mapping type is a data type comprised of a collection of keys and
        associated values. Python's only built-in mapping type is the
        dictionary.  Dictionaries implement the
        `associative array <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array>`__
        abstract data type.

    memo
        Temporary storage of precomputed values to avoid duplicating the same computation.

    mutable data value
        A data value which can be modified. The types of all mutable values 
        are compound types.  Lists and dictionaries are mutable; strings
        and tuples are not.
